## HTML Page
First I created index page with all the main sections that I wanted in my portfolio. I also decided that I will have few clickable elements using GET and POST APIs for the contact section.

## CSS
I used the idea from a template with black layout using bootstrap and font awesome styling, micons and lora fonts

## JS
I used Get API for the 'DOWNLOAD.CV'
I used Get API to get data from github api
I used Post Api to submit a contact form (results are consol.logged)
I also tried to separate files in import/export as well as classes but unfortunately my browser gives me error so I just coomented those fields
